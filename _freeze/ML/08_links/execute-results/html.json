Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com), that provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both can run on PCs, Macs or Linux. Students will be learning R in the stats labs using the lab manual []().\n\n### Additional R resources\n\n1. Google is great, Google your problem\n2. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is great, google will often take you there because someone has already asked your question, and someone else has answered, usually many people have answered your question many ways.\n3.
